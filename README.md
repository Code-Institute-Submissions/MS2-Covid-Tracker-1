# World and Philippines Covid 19 Tracker 

#### This website is my attempt at creating a Covid-19 Tracker that shows current global data with additional focus on Philippines setting. As of now there are many Covid-19 websites tracker out there however majority of which only has data available for each countries. Thus I added another section for local data for Philippine settings. 

# UX

## USER STORIES
* As a user, I would like to know the current total covid-19 data as well as daily data worldwide
* As a user, I would like to know the current total data for each country 
* As a user, I would like to be able to view the world wide and each country's data at the same time for comparison
* As a user, I would like to know the current covid-19 data per province in the philippines
* As a user, I would like to know the demography of these cases per gender and age range
* As a user, I should be able determine the location of these places from the map

## Design

  #### I decided to create 2 sections for this project for comparison purposes. The 1st section deals with the data in a global scale by providing the worldwide covid-19 stats and the ability to check each countries situtation. The 2nd section deals with providing local data in the Philippines. 

## Color Scheme


## Typography
* The "Roboto" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly. "Roboto" is a  clean font which is both attractive and appropriate.

## Responsiveness 

# WIREFRAMES
#### I used Balsamiq Wireframe 4 to create the framework for the website. There have been several modifications as the project progressed but below are the final outputs:

* Desktop View
* Ipad View
* Mobile  View

# FEATURES
## EXISTING FEATURES

#### I wanted to make this a simple yet informative site thus I've decided to give it a minimalist approach. I only used data that a typical user would like to see. 
#### I used charts to display percentages of confirm cases per gender and age as it's easier to interprete. 
#### Google Map is used to display location of a specific province. 

## FUTURE FEATURES

### Add map functionality for the 1st section so that when user chose a country then they will have an idea of its location.
### Add a Continent category for the country list so it will give additional knowledge to the user which continent a country belongs to.

## API USED

### There are 2 APIs used for this project:
* Covid19 API - used to generate Confirmed Cases, Deaths and Recoveries 
* Google Map API - used to generate specific location of a province

### Challenges:
* One of the challenges is for the Province Data. Unfortunately, there are no available API for local covid-19 data in Philippines thus I ended up creating a csv then converted it to a JSON object. The disadvantage of which is I would need to manually update the csv to reflect updated numbers in my website. 

#TECHNOLOGY USED
